Make buffer that is autoadjusted from the amount of memory that we have (maybe an input). and will dump after filling up
	- should be good because soft clipping max can only be a read lead length at max, so can dump duplicates from earlier in the sorted file

look at hamming distances for all the barcodes. if there is a substantial gap between them -> Make UMI's that are 1-2 hamming distance off of an existing UMI be classified as that UMI code
	-need to verify how often UMI error occurs. if its pretty often, dont want to risk one being classified as another *maybe only 1 distance off. if its not so often, should good.


SUBTRACT 1 WHEN MAKING 5 PRIME START WHEN NEGETIVE STRANDED
	-when doing negetive strand we only care about the right side soft clipping.
	-position +  <#>M  +  <#>S  -  1
	- if theres more like N you add all of it
	- should account for deletions (add them in)
	- should not account for insertions

For foward strand
	- positon - <#>S  is all.
